# Smart BaseCoffee Machine Software Design Project
 
**In this project, you will design software for a smart coffee machine that allows users to make various decisions according to their preferences.**

Note: The main objective of the project is to explore different ways of designing. By implementing concepts such as **Interface**, **Abstract Class**, and **Enum**, I aim to gain practical experience in software design. Therefore, let's strive to apply the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, including **_Inheritance_**, **_Abstraction_**, **_Polymorphism_**, and **_Encapsulation_**.

## Requirements
 
### Your coffee machine should include the following types of coffee

1. Americano
2. Espresso
3. Cappucino
4. Latte
5. Mocha
6. Macchiato
7. Affogato
8. Iced BaseCoffee (Cold Brew)
9. Frappuccino (Cold BaseCoffee)
10. IrishCoffee BaseCoffee

These coffee types represent the variety of options that your smart coffee machine should be able to prepare.
